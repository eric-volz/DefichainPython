## The Defichain Python Library has reached version 1.0.0!


Dear Defichain Community,

a few weeks ago I released version 1.0.0 of the [Defichain Python Library](https://github.com/eric-volz/DefichainPython).

All methods of the Defichain node and Ocean commands to pull data have already been implemented and tested.

The documentation of the single methods is not finished yet, but will follow in the next weeks.
You can see the progress of the different parts of the project [here](https://docs.defichain-python.de/build/html/instructions/progressAndUpdates.html).

To ensure an easy start with the library I have created a [Quickstart](https://docs.defichain-python.de/build/html/instructions/quickstart.html) Guide.

For people who want to get to know the Defichain Node through this library there will be a ["How to install and configure a Defichain Node"](https://docs.defichain-python.de/build/html/additionalInfos/installDefichainNode.html) Guide.

Here are some important links around the project:
- [Github](https://github.com/eric-volz/DefichainPython)
- [Documentation](https://docs.defichain-python.de/)
- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/defichain/)

Now is the best time to develop new applications or trading bots: Money is made in bear markets!

Install the Defichain Python library now via pip:
```bash
pip install defichain
```
